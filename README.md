# share-as-vxtwitter

I don't know and don't care how it works. I vibe coded it in 10 minutes with literally zero android edvelopment knowlage and experience. No feature updates are planned, that's the final app.

This is a simple app, that will show in your "Share" menu, and just will replace x.com domain with vxtwitter.com domain in URL you share. You click the app, and it opens the same "Share" menu with the new link.
